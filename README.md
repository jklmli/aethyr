## Aethyr

My submission into the 2011 Facebook Hackathon.
It started out as a proof-of-concept man-in-the-middle attack on DAAP, which
is used by the iTunes client.

I'm no longer maintaining this at all out of lack of interest.

Feel free to fork, but be warned the code is pretty...bad.
The repo itself is ~50MB from saving all the binaries, you'll have to manually
build it yourself (no Makefile), code smells galore, and other hidden surprises!
